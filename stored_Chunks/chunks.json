And yet in schools we often try to shortcut the complex processes \ninvolved in writing in a race to get to the product \u2013 the written \noutcome itself. Our education system \u2013 driven along by standardised \nassessments and high stakes testing \u2013 seems to demand that we hurry \nalong and get to \u2018the point\u2019 . Rather than carefully stepping through the \nrequired stages of writing \u2013 including reading and planning, generating \nideas, drafting, refining and editing \u2013 students are often placed in the \nunfortunate position of having to write only by imitation. Formulaic \nessay structures, which should only be used as scaffolds, become the \nultimate ends, and writing is reduced from a process to a product. This is by no means the fault of teachers. In \u2018content-heavy\u2019 subjects, \nsuch as the Sciences and Humanities, examination pressures dictate \nthat writing should be taught as a means to an end. Even in the English \nclassroom the pressures of senior secondary assessment dominate the \nwriting landscape, with essay structures reverberating down from Year \n12 through to the junior levels. But it doesn\u2019t have to happen this way.",

As a result, we\u2019ll never really know the full impact of shifting \nour focus away from writing based on Year 7 and 9 NAPLAN results. Then, something surprised us. During the COVID years, we started to \nget the best Victorian Certificate of Education results we had seen. In \nVictoria, Year 12 students must complete at least one of the English \nstudies. For us, roughly 80% of our students complete VCE English. In 2020 and 2021, we saw our best results in more than a decade, as \nmeasured by students in the high 30s and 40-plus scores, and also by \nstudents in the lower ranges drawing closer to the state average. So, while the shift in focus away from writing and towards reading had \nno clear impact on NAPLAN, it seemed to have had a significant impact \non our senior results. Comparing the kinds of essays students were \nwriting in 2017 to those they write now, it\u2019s easy to see why. Focusing \non close reading, discussing texts and prioritising student voice has \nresulted in writing that is much more vibrant and personal. Practical \nReading Strategies explains how we got there. With the Reading Strategies safely tucked under our belts, we started \nto shift our attention back to writing. Towards the end of 2020, we \nbegan to develop and refine a process of writing that was backed up \nby the Reading Strategies. As a result, we developed our Writing Cycle.",

It begins with a model text, teaches \nthe language and formal conventions, scaffolds practice of the skills, \nand directs students to create an original text using the conventions \nand techniques derived from the model. Genre writing builds on the \nproduct model, with more of a focus on the generic conventions. In \ngenre writing, the language techniques highlighted by the product \nwriting approach are grounded in the conventions of the genre. We believe there is a false dichotomy between process and product \u2013 \nstudents need to be taught via both approaches. A focus on product \nwriting can lead to decontextualised instruction, for example, of \ngrammar or language techniques. On the other hand, research has \npointed to evidence that process writing may disadvantage struggling \nwriters (AERO, 2022, p14). The Writing Cycle incorporates elements of both methods of \ninstruction. Like process writing, it follows a clear structure to support \nstudents throughout the creation of their texts. Like product and genre \nwriting, we use models (mentor texts) and explicit instruction of skills, \nwhich are contextualised by the texts they study in class. Overview of the Writing Cycle\nIn the creation of the Writing Cycle we are indebted to several other \nauthors and educators who have produced amazing work on writing \nas a process (for example, see Moon, 2011; Derewianka, 2015). We developed the Cycle alongside the Reading Strategies, always \ncoming from a position of reading first, writing later. Both authors \nof this text write regularly \u2013 Ben has written many texts for English \nteachers, and Leon writes both nonfiction and fiction.

It is important to note that even these initial planning stages of the \nwriting process benefit from clear instruction, scaffolding and support. Providing students with examples and guided instruction on how  to \nidentify and lock into the purpose of their writing is vital; you can\u2019t just \ntell students to \u2018plan\u2019 a piece of writing and leave it at that. Steven Graham, in his essay on writing communities, discusses the \nimportance of \u201chow writing is conceptualised within a community in \nterms of purpose, including writing goals, norms and stance\u201d (Graham, \n2018). Students may think of the same text in many different ways based \non their understanding of purpose and audience. If it is not made clear \nto them from the outset, this could lead to unintended results. Graham \nprovides the example of a writing task about the connection between \nhip-hop and rhythm and blues music, and points out that students\u2019 \nwork will vary dependent on their own musical knowledge and tastes, \ntheir personality, their physical and mental state at the time of writing, \nand many other factors. Because of this, it is doubly important to ensure \nthe class has a clear and agreed upon starting point. In this book, we divide the overall purpose of a text into three categories: \npurpose, audience and context. Purpose\nThis is the reason for the text\u2019s existence. It may be something as \nsimple as the function of the writing. Applebee (1984) suggested \n\u2018informational\u2019 , \u2018personal\u2019 and \u2018imaginative\u2019 as suitable categories of \nwriting.

The audience should be \nmade as specific as possible if students are aiming for a piece that \nappeals emotionally or logically to the readers, whatever the purpose. In a 2022 review of the NAPLAN writing test, AERO report that \u201cover \none-third (38%) of Year 9 students achieved a score of 3 or less out of \na possible 6 for the criterion addressing audience\u201d (AERO, 2022, pxi).

In \nthe classroom, you will vary the amount of time spent covering each \nelement dependent on the outcome you\u2019re seeking. For example, if \nstudents are going to write a persuasive piece, then audience, purpose \nand context are very important.

The Write, Organise, Link, Expand phases of this \nactivity are designed to help students brainstorm, write and think more \ndeeply about their topics. In the first step, students should engage in freewriting and write down \nas many ideas as they can think of. Step two involves organising these \nideas into groups or links. By doing this, students can begin to see a \npicture forming of their topic. In step four, students can delve deeper \ninto their topic by conducting research, finding mentor texts and \ndeepening their knowledge of the topic. Teacher instructions\nThese instructions outline a four-step process for brainstorming and \norganising ideas around a specific topic. 1. Write: In this step, students are encouraged to write down as  \nmany ideas as they can about the topic. This is a \u2018brain dump\u2019 \nphase where students shouldn\u2019t worry about the quality or \nrelevance of their ideas, but rather focus on generating as many \nideas as possible. 2. Organise: Once students have written as many ideas as they can, \nthey should then group these ideas into similar categories such \nas ideas, themes, characters or settings. This can be done through \ncolour-coding similar categories with the same colour or by \norganising the ideas into a chart or graphic. 3.",

This process involves identifying any \ngrammatical, spelling, punctuation or factual errors and implementing \nfixes to ensure the writing is clear. The goal of the error hunt is to tidy up all the final bits and pieces. By \ntaking the time to carefully review and edit their work, students will be \nable to ensure their writing effectively conveys the right message and \navoids any misunderstandings or confusion. As teachers, we want our students to focus on the generation and \nselection of ideas for their writing projects. After that, we ensure they \nare structured appropriately, written for the appropriate audience and \nconvey the intended meaning. Only now do we focus on the mechanics \nof the language. Teacher instructions\n1. Have students print out the writing project they need to revise. 2. Supply students with a blank piece of paper. They should also have \na highlighter and a pen. 3. Place the blank piece of paper over the writing project so that \nstudents can only see one line of writing at a time. 4. Have students read through each line of text and highlight any \nwords that are misspelled or out of context. 5. Encourage students to annotate any words that sound weird or out \nof place.

So let me ask you this: what makes it appropriate to take a children\u2019s show \nand politicize it, turning it into a political statement instead of a source of \nentertainment? I don\u2019t want my kids one day watching a political mess, a \nshadow of what a great show once was. I think if writers want to add more variety to their reboots, they should simply \nintroduce new characters, which always gives them a way out if they don\u2019t \nwork, instead of completely changing the old ones and the show in the \nprocess. It comes to a point where the writer needs to ask themselves if they \nare writing a once beloved show for the new generation or a completely new \none. There are many other shows this has happened to, and it needs to be \nstopped or policed.",

Because the emphasis \nof this Writing Cycle is on producing authentic work, students will need \nto collaborate at some point, either with the teacher, with each other or \nwith a third party. Collaboration comes in many forms. At this stage of the cycle, students \nshould have a rough draft of their writing, which is ready for peer review \nand editing. This can be a daunting prospect for any writer. There must \nbe a strong and healthy culture of respect, critical engagement and \ntrust in the classroom to collaborate effectively.

This is, at the time of writing, a \ncontentious area, which warrants much more exploration.

We believe that \nthese technologies will inevitably make their way into our classrooms \u2013 \nif they\u2019re not there already. Therefore, it is our role to teach their ethical \nand appropriate use, rather than trying fruitlessly to ban or avoid them. LLMs use enormous datasets of written text to produce a convincing \nreplica of human language. Feed them a suitable prompt, such as \u2018write \na short story in the style of Ernest Hemingway\u2019 , and they will produce \na reasonable output. They can also write in an academic style and \nvoice appropriate to essays and more formal writing, even providing \nreferences and citations. But machine writers cannot reflect. They often \nfabricate information, create false references and facts, and mislead \nthemselves by going off topic or down self-directed rabbit holes. Because of this, students should be taught how to use these AI writers \nas tools rather than as a replacement for their own writing.

Consider writing (or having one or more students write) a \nforeword or introduction to the collection which contextualises \nthe essays. \u2022  Use a free online publishing tool like Google Sites or Wordpress \nto make an online anthology of writing, such as a poetry site or \ncollection of short stories. \u2022  Record students reading work aloud as part of a video collection \nor YouTube playlist. \u2022  Create a student newspaper or magazine, particularly for opinion \npieces, editorials and persuasive texts. \u2022  Print class or year level short story anthologies. Go through an \neditorial process with the students to long-list and short-list \nsuccessful stories for publication. \u2022  Use PowerPoint or Google Slides to produce an anthology of short \nfiction such as poetry or flash fiction. \u2022  Host a reading, with students reading to their peers, the school \ncommunity and parents. This might be used in tandem with a \nbook launch. \u2022  Use professional self-publishing services (such as IngramSpark \nor Amazon) to produce and print an anthology of writing for sale.

Consider multiple forms of assessment, \nincluding folios, oral assessment and multimodal assessments. The Writing Cycle can immediately replace some of your existing units. For example, it is highly likely that you currently have units on creative \nwriting, such as short stories or poetry, or on analytical writing such as \nan essay response. It is equally likely that these units are text-centred, \nwith the creative writing based on a specific author, or the analytical \nin response to a particular text. Swapping those units out with the \nWriting Cycle removes the need for a central text in favour of the short \nmentor texts. The first example below is ideal for introducing students to the Writing \nCycle, as it steps them through each stage slowly and deliberately. It \nmay be worth incorporating this unit into the junior years as a general \nintroduction to writing practices. It is also worth bearing in mind that the \ncycle can be iterated through more than once. So, in a unit of work like \nthe second example, a teacher may decide to take students through the \ncycle two to three times to continuously refine and improve their writing. The following two examples have been developed for Years 7 and 8 \njunior English classes. They can, however, be easily adapted up or \ndown through the year levels.",

If student A writes a blog, \nstudent B a folio of poetry and student C an essay, many teachers would \nfind it difficult to assess these different responses against a common set \nof criteria. Yet, if we truly value the writing process over the product, \nthere will be many occasions where this more flexible approach is \nappropriate, and where student choice should be encouraged. While it might be more straightforward to decide that every student \nmust write a blog post, a short story, an essay or some other common \nform, comparative marking can be achieved across different forms as \nlong as the criteria is focused on shared, assessable aspects of the task. When developing comparative criteria for assessing different text types, \nit may be useful to ask the following questions:\n\u2022  How can students change the form of the text, while keeping the \nsame purpose, audience and elements of the context? \u2022  Is there an \u2018ideal\u2019 form for the outcome of this task? \u2022  Is it worth presenting multiple options or letting students choose \nfrom any form? \u2022  What is being assessed, and what form(s) are the most suitable \nvehicle for those outcomes? \u2022  Is a written outcome the best decision for what we want to assess?

Teachers as writers\nWriting is a great creative outlet, but it also helps to sharpen your \nideas around concepts and content. It can go a long way to improving \nfeelings of self-efficacy and proficiency even in areas you may usually \nfind out of your comfort zone. Over our years teaching \u2013 despite \nEnglish being our main method \u2013 we\u2019ve both taught, and written \nabout, digital technologies, STEAM, humanities, and entrepreneurial \neducation. Writing for or about a subject forces you to identify gaps in \nyour knowledge and research what\u2019s missing, whether it\u2019s your main \nmethod or not. Writing is essential to communication, and teaching is essentially all \nabout communication. Whether it\u2019s the ability to clearly articulate \nan idea to a student, or crafting a carefully worded email to a parent, \nteachers rely on written communication skills as part of the daily job. But there are ways to extend these natural skills beyond the ordinary. Writing in the classroom\nThe most obvious place to start honing your skills \u2013 and one of the \nmost beneficial \u2013 is in the classroom. As English teachers, there are \nobviously times when it\u2019s useful for us to be able to model writing \nin various forms for students, from demonstrating how to construct \na sentence through to taking a class through an entire essay or short \nstory. Producing the writing yourself also gives you the ultimate quality \ncontrol \u2013 many teachers have probably faced a situation where they\u2019re \ngoing through something written by another author, only to find that \nthe meaning is obscured, the content isn\u2019t entirely in the right context \nor the quality is low.

For example, a teacher \nmight create a unique text using a mentor text, mirroring the process \nthey expect from their students. Or a teacher might choose to model a \nparticular skill or technique, working through it live in front of the class. Try incorporating some of the following into your lessons:\n\u2022  Whenever you ask your students to write anything \u2013 from a short \nanswer to a paragraph \u2013 be prepared to demonstrate some or all \nof the same writing on the whiteboard. \u2022  Be critical of your own writing. Write, and then edit, in front of the \nclass. Ask for feedback and suggestions from the students. \u2022  Articulate the purpose, audience and context of your own writing.

Workshops on creative \nwriting are a fun and engaging way to help build culture at any year \nlevel. Senior students might benefit from visits where the author talks \nthrough the writing process of a text they are studying. In the junior \nyear levels, more interactive workshops might have students writing \ntheir own poetry, flash fiction or short stories under the guidance of a \npublished author. Try to vary the authors you have visit your school to represent the \ndiverse range of texts studied across year levels. Choose authors \nwho will appeal to specific cohorts and address strategic needs. For example, if you know from your data that there is a literacy gap \nbetween boys and girls in the middle years, consider finding an author \nwho might appeal to those boys. School anthologies\nIn stage 6 of the writing cycle, Publication, we outlined different \nways to publish student work. Of these, school anthologies probably \ndo the most to celebrate your school\u2019s culture of writing. We\u2019ve seen \ngreat examples of school writing anthologies used to fundraise and \nas seasonal gifts, for example, end-of-year or Christmas anthologies \nof writing. Some schools have developed a longstanding tradition of \nan annual publication. These anthologies allow students from all year \nlevels to contribute and demonstrate their best writing across a variety \nof forms. ",

Although these apps aren\u2019t perfect, \nthey can do a decent job of reproducing humanlike writing in a variety  \nof forms. There are important ethical concerns over AI, including with the \u2018large \nlanguage models\u2019 that underpin the writing tech. These range from \nprivacy concerns to copyright infringement, and even the use of low-\npaid labour and the environmental impact of the technologies. This \nbook isn\u2019t the place for these discussions, but Kate Crawford\u2019s (2021) \nAtlas of AI is an excellent resource if you\u2019re interested in the ethics of AI. There are two areas which we think will have an impact on the future \nof writing in schools. \u2018Spinners\u2019 , paraphrasing and plagiarism\nThe current most prominent use of these programmes in education \nis, sadly, cheating. The rise of AI paraphrasing apps, sometimes called \n\u2018spinners\u2019 , is concerning in both secondary and tertiary education. Spinners take any text and reformulate it into a paraphrased passage. We have seen these used by students in tertiary studies where students \nare required to provide summaries of their readings. We have also \nseen them used by students in the Humanities and Sciences subjects \nin secondary school. The paraphrased output is unique and therefore \npasses plagiarism tests, making them hard to spot. As well as spinners, many free and pay-per-word sites offer complete \nessay-writing services, which are underpinned by large language \nmodels (LLMs) \u2013 \u2018deep learning\u2019 models, which reproduce language \nusing a large data set.

When \nElizabeth visits Charlotte Lucas, her friend tells her, \u201cHappiness \nin marriage is entirely a matter of chance\u201d (Austen 33). This \nstatement highlights the lack of romantic expectations for \nmarriage, as Charlotte sees it simply as a means of achieving \nfinancial stability. Furthermore, when Elizabeth rejects Mr. Collins\u2019 proposal, he tries to persuade her by saying, \u201cMy \nreasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for \nevery clergyman in easy circumstances\u2026to set the example of \nmatrimony in his parish\u201d (Austen 39).

But like the spinners, these apps produce unique writing, which can \npass a plagiarism test, meaning that detection \u2013 for now \u2013 remains the \npurview of the human assessor. These technologies raise an interesting question, and one which we \nhave already addressed elsewhere in this book: what is the point \nof writing? When students can hit a button to generate a passable \nessay, what is the value in teaching essay writing? Similarly, once the \ntechnology is sufficiently advanced to create compelling stories, does \nthat make the teaching of creative writing redundant? Of course not.

From \nmost pessimistic to most optimistic, here are a few:\n\u2022  Scenario 1: Acknowledging that students can go online and get \nfree AI-written essays, the education system responds by a total \nban on technology \u2013 a little like banning phones in classrooms \nbecause they\u2019re distracting, rather than educating students on the \nappropriate use of technology. All essays must now be written by \nhand, preferably under timed conditions. The system rejects AI, \nlike antibodies attacking a foreign object. \u2022  Scenario 2: Schools adopt a blended approach where students \nmust draft extensively by hand and in class before being allowed \nto type up final essays. Final submissions are checked against \ndrafted materials closely and at great expense to teacher time to \nauthenticate work. Some students are canny enough to know that \na teacher with more than 20 students in a class can\u2019t be watching \neverything all the time and copying an AI essay by hand as a \u2018first \ndraft\u2019 is very tempting. \u2022  Scenario 3: Teachers acknowledge that the problem isn\u2019t going \naway any time soon. We start directing our teaching more towards \nthe purpose(s) of essay writing, and the ethics of cheating. Knowing that for some students the essay will never be an \nappropriate form of assessment, we find alternate ways to check \ntheir knowledge and skills. \u2022  Scenario 4: AI writing replaces human writing for most functional \nuses. Writing is still taught as an expressive art, as something with \nmental health benefits, and as a tool for articulating thought and \ncommunicating.
