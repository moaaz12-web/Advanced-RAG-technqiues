We joined the Victorian Association for the Teaching of \nEnglish (VATE) in a community of practice research project in an effort \nto answer it. Rather than beginning with the question \u2018what is reading?\u2019 , \nhowever, the Year 7 teachers \u2013 myself included \u2013 were instructed to ask \nthe students \u2018how does reading make you feel?\u2019\nThe connection with reading on an emotional as well as a logical level \nbecame one of the underpinning factors of the reading project. In \nresponse to that initial prompt, students drew illustrations of reading \nthat ranged from magical book-filled worlds to shark-infested waters. The reason that reading prompts such a visceral reaction in some \nstudents \u2013 and some adults \u2013 is as complex as the definition itself. A web \nof situational, contextual factors impacts upon a person\u2019s individual \nexperience of reading (Gee, 2004). Some of these factors include: early \neducation; time spent reading at home in infancy; access to books; \nsocioeconomic status; cognitive ability; level of technology use; and \nquality of instruction (Scholastic Corporation, 2021). The further we probe the question, the deeper we descend into the \ncomplexities of a reader\u2019s context.",

Even among the teachers, we \nhad broad-ranging definitions of what occurs behind our eyes when \nwe read. For some, reading offers up a full sensory experience: moving \npictures, sounds and smells, or memories associated with the words \non the page. For others, the experience is more like a series of stills or \nblack and white photographs. Some, such as those with aphantasia \n\u2013 the inability to create mental pictures \u2013 may be able to render only \nsmall portions of text at a time, if at all (Clemens, 2021). So, in trying to answer the question \u2018what is reading?\u2019 , we ultimately \ndecided that attempting to define such a complex process, a process \nimpacted by cultural, physical, mental and social factors, would be \nfruitless. None of the existing definitions of reading capture the entire \npicture, and rather than attempting to reduce or refine those definitions, \nwe shifted our attention to focus on a different question: \u2018how can we \nteach reading?\u2019",

We returned to the VATE community \nof practice in 2019 with a suite of lessons and ideas that developed \nstudents\u2019 ability to read through close reading, explicit vocabulary \nand grammar instruction, contextual and social activities, dramatic \nactivities and more.

Synthesising\nThe six Reading Strategies gave us a framework around which to \ndevelop our whole school approach to reading: a system. It allowed us \nto investigate how a given activity might encourage a student to connect \nwith the text on a personal, contextual level, and then lead naturally on \nto another, which encourages them to question for themselves aspects \nof the text. The inferring strategy highlighted a major gap in our existing \nsystem: we had spent a lot of time teaching students what  to think \nabout text, but not how  to think. The Reading Strategies are not hierarchical, but there is logic to the order. Most teachers will be familiar with Bloom\u2019s taxonomy. Sometimes, in \nteacher education, Bloom\u2019s taxonomy is held up as a fixed and linear \napproach to cognition. Subsequent research into how we think has \nchallenged that notion. The excellent work from Project Zero at Harvard \nUniversity, which resulted in the Visible Thinking Routines, suggests \nthat at any given time we might range across multiple categories \n(Morrison, Ritchhart & Church, 2013).

Text-to-text\nPart of any reader\u2019s experience is also formed by the other texts they \nhave encountered. This may include other forms of media such as \ntelevision, film and digital. A student with a wide repertoire of prior \nreading will find it much easier to access new texts that are related to \nthings they have seen before. But text-to-text connections are not just \nthe privilege of strong readers: leveraging intertextual knowledge can \nbe done deliberately in the classroom by preparing reading material \naround  a core text, engineering connections for students who may not \nhave encountered them before (see Activity 3: Context Walk). Text-to-world\nThe bigger-picture connections of text-to-world include a reader\u2019s \nunderstanding of the contexts in which texts are written, as well as the \nglobal context in which they live. Understanding major historical events \n\u2013 for example, the world wars, 9/11, colonisation and the displacement \nof indigenous peoples \u2013 provides another connection, which reduces \nthe cognitive load of reading new texts. James Gee (2004) discusses that, \u201c All words take on nuanced meanings \nin context and they can take on new meanings in new contexts. \u201d These \n\u2018situated meanings\u2019 of words are highly dependent on a student\u2019s ability to \nmake connections \u2013 to themselves, other texts and the world around them. The following activities target all three of Keene and Zimmerman\u2019s \nconnections, either focusing on them individually, or taking them as a \ngroup. The activities use annotation, discussion and reflection to draw \nconnections to the core text. Beginning with the simplest \u2013 but possibly \nmost versatile \u2013 of the activities, the Text Walk, students will explicitly \nidentify links to extracts of a central text. This idea is then expanded upon \nin a contextualising activity, and further developed through coding and \nfinally mapping.",

This activity ensures students dwell on \na text to produce a more robust reading. Instructions for teachers\n1. Begin with a reading of a text or an extract of a text. The text could \nbe read aloud as a class or individually. Students do not need to \nannotate the text on the first reading. 2. After reading the text, write a simple declarative statement about the \ntext on the board. This might be a statement such as: \u2018The character \nBernice is angry\u2019 or \u2018 An important value in this extract is justice\u2019 . 3. Instruct students to form a \u2018Why\u2026?\u2019 question around the statement. For example, \u2018Why is Bernice angry?\u2019 or \u2018Why is justice important in \nthis extract?\u2019\n4.

Overall, \nhowever, the unit has moved away from a discussion of Northern Lights \nand towards a skills-based unit centred on the Strategies. In fact, this \nunit plan could now be applied to any text, with very different results. For example, the central text of Northern Lights could be replaced with a \nnonfiction biography, or a collection of persuasive articles on an issue, \nor a multimodal text such as a graphic novel or film.

The progression through Year 7 to 10 \nfocuses on building the students\u2019 skill sets very deliberately. Whereas \na traditional curriculum requires Year 7s to immediately write in both \npersuasive and narrative modes (and for some schools even, analytical), \nthese units build gradually from personal, reflective writing up to \nanalytical in Year 10. Students will still be prepared for senior school \nEnglish, but without the unnecessary burden of beginning analytical \nwriting before they are fully prepared. From a teaching point of view, it is very refreshing to offer students in \nYears 7 and 8 more opportunities to explore and develop their own \n\u2018voice\u2019 as opposed to filling their heads with limiting structures like \nTEEL or a list of \u2018key quotes\u2019 from a class text. There is also a balance of digital texts, reading, writing, media literacy, \nand speaking and listening. All of these various forms of literacy are \nimportant for a student preparing to navigate a world filled with \ncomplex texts, many of which are designed to persuade and mislead. The traditional approach \u2013 relying on NAPLAN and senior school-style \npersuasive texts \u2013 is unfortunately divorced from the real world. And yet, the skills learned in addressing real critical media literacy are \napplicable to those standardised and high-stakes exams. What works \nfor NAPLAN does not work in the real world, but what works in the \nreal world does work for NAPLAN. This is the most important part of \ncreating a diverse and engaging English curriculum.",

I \noften think that English teachers are lucky to have such an open and \nobviously skills-based curriculum; however, in Australia, the updated \nAustralian Curriculum is seeing a shift away from content and towards \nskills in all subject areas, even those traditionally more content heavy, \nsuch as Science and The Humanities. While we wait for the shift, the best way to encourage teachers to adopt \nthese practices is through word of mouth. Work with teachers who \nare keen to try new techniques and to expand their understanding of \nliteracy. When they are successful in improving the reading in their \nclassrooms, make sure they are vocal about it. Look for opportunities \nto share ideas in faculty meetings or staff professional learning and try \nto get people on board organically.

Once we understand why  reading is important, it\u2019s hard to argue \nagainst the benefits of creating a culture of reading in your school.",

The more comfortably the reading culture sits within the bigger \nsystems of the school, the more likely it will be to stick. Once you have a vision, investigate possibilities for improving the \nculture, such as those that follow. Structured silent reading\nMany schools have some form of silent reading built into their classes, \nparticularly in Year 7-10 English classes. This might be 10 minutes of \nsilent reading at the beginning or end of every lesson, or a block of \ntime once a week. They may be tracked \u2013 ie with a reading log \u2013 or \nnot. Whichever way you choose to organise a structured silent reading \nprogram, always refer back to the bigger picture of the reading culture \nvision. Is it important that you track what the students are reading? If so, why? If not, what measures can you put in place to try to avoid students \n(and teachers!) taking liberties with the time? Silent reading can be an \nincredibly powerful way of giving students the time to read for pleasure, \nbut it must be consistent and well managed. n this first example, an existing unit on Northern Lights has been First \nof all, it is important to develop a shared vision among the students and \nstaff about what reading is, and why it is important. The introduction to \nthis book explores some of what, but it is crucial that staff understand \nthe complexities of reading as a process if they are to expect to improve \nreading among the students.

The exception to this might be if you choose to have a form of \nconversation or reading log as part of the silent reading program. Even \nso, teachers should use any opportunities to model good reading habits, \nincluding talking about what they\u2019re currently reading and discussing \nbooks with students. Classroom libraries\nClassroom libraries are common in primary schools, but less so in \nsecondary. This might be due to a lack of ownership of the classroom \u2013 \nit\u2019s often likely that one classroom might be home to multiple subjects \nand teachers. Or it might be a resourcing issue, particularly in larger \nschools. If possible, I\u2019d recommend a box or a bookshelf per English \nclass, particularly if the class is involved in a silent reading program.

The important thing for students to realise is that authors are \nreal people. It escapes the attention of many students that writing is a \nprofession, and that those who choose to do it have a particular skill set \nthat they work at for a living. Authors can range from very cheap to incredibly expensive, depending \non their profile. If possible, I\u2019d recommend at least one author visit per \nyear level per year, spread out over the calendar. Preferably, some of \nthese should be the authors of texts studied in class.
